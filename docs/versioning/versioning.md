Importance of Versioning
- Set version support policy (how long the api will be supported)
- Include versioning in the API

Versioning in the API
- Version can come in three forms:
  - In the URL (the most common and easiest to implement)
  - In a Header (the most correct form)
  - In a query parameter (do not use)
