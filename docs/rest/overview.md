# REST API Overview

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol -- the HTTP. REST APIs are designed around resources, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.

## Key Characteristics of REST
- **Stateless**: Each request from client to server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
- **Client-Server**: The client and server are separate entities, allowing them to evolve independently.
- **Cacheable**: Responses must define themselves as cacheable or non-cacheable.
- **Uniform Interface**: The key principle that simplifies and decouples the architecture, enabling each part to evolve independently.
